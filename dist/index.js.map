The assumption is\n\t * that if you actually want to print the string \"null\" or \"undefined\",\n\t * then that's easy to do that when you're calling extsprintf; on the\n\t * other hand, if you did NOT want that (i.e., there's actually a bug\n\t * where the program assumes some variable is non-null and tries to\n\t * print it, which might happen when constructing a packet or file in\n\t * some specific format), then it's better to stop immediately than\n\t * produce bogus output.\n\t *\n\t * However, sometimes the bug is only in the code calling VError, and a\n\t * programmer might prefer to have the error message contain \"null\" or\n\t * \"undefined\" rather than have the bug in the error path crash the\n\t * program (making the first bug harder to identify).  For that reason,\n\t * by default VError converts \"null\" or \"undefined\" arguments to their\n\t * string representations and passes those to extsprintf.
